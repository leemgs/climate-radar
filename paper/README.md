## ðŸ§© Abstract
As climate-related hazards intensify, conventional early warning systems (EWS) disseminate alerts rapidly but often fail to trigger timely protective actions, leading to preventable losses and inequities.  
We introduce **Climate RADAR (Risk-Aware, Dynamic, and Action Recommendation system)** â€” a **generative AIâ€“based reliability layer** that reframes disaster communication from alerts delivered to actions executed.  

The system integrates meteorological, hydrological, vulnerability, and social data into a **composite risk index** and employs **guardrail-embedded large language models (LLMs)** to deliver personalized recommendations across citizen, volunteer, and municipal interfaces.  

Evaluation through simulations, user studies, and a municipal pilot demonstrates improved outcomes, including higher protective action execution, reduced response latency, and increased usability and trust.  
By combining **predictive analytics, behavioral science, and responsible AI**, Climate RADAR advances **people-centered, transparent, and equitable early warning systems**, offering practical pathways toward compliance-ready disaster resilience infrastructures.

## ðŸ§  Research Focus
> Bridging the gap between **climate alerts** and **real-world protective actions** through generative AI.
